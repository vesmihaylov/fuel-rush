# Fuel Rush

Hello and thanks for your attention on this project. This is my first game in Unity that I make while learning game development.
It's a simple low poly racing game which gives you the ability to race against AI. The first version has only 1 racetrack. In the future I plan to add more maps and more functionality to make the game look better. Inspiration came from games I played in my childhood and while I was a teenager. Big names such as Need for Speed, Live for Speed, Grand Theft Auto, Colin McRae and many more franchise games. Here are some screenshots below from the time I'm writing this readme file.
